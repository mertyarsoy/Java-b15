    POSSIBLE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:

     1-What is abstract ? and can you clarify it with little bit details?

     -->Abstract is a way to organize the methods with only NECESSARY information(template)
     you do not have body for abstract methods.It means people can  see the template of
     the method and "OVERRIDE" this based on their requirements.

     NOTE:We do not have a body for abstract methods because every class extends to the abstract class
     can MAKE THEIR OWN IMPLEMENTATION.

     2-Why do you need to have abstract class in your project?

     *For many methods,we need developers to make their own implementation to reduce the amount of
     duplication in the project which cause memory slowness,system slowness,more execution for system.

     3-Where do you use abstract class in your project?

     I would definitely say that I use general OOPS concept in everwhere of my project.In automation
     script I do not use too much,but I know that my team developers are using.

     4-Can you create an object from abstract class? If no, How are you going to
     access all of the methods and variables from that class

     NO,you cannot create an object from Abstract class. TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THESE METHODS AND
     VARIABLES YOU NEED TO OVERRIDE THEM.(Extends from parent to child)

     5-Can you have normal and abstract method inside of abstract class?

       -->Yes, you can have both of the method types inside of Abstract class

       -->please rewatch videos
       -->Please review the notes
       -->Please watch youtube videos
